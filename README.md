# OOP_Project
As the final project in Orient Objected Programming, we will create an RPG that takes place inside a cave.

## Run
In the root of the repository, you can either:
 - Use `javac **/*.java` or `javac **/*.java **/**/*.java` to compile every java file, and run `java src.game.Main` to execute the game.
 - Install Apache Ant, and run `ant`.

## Assets
We used two asset packs:
 - [Kyrise's Free 16x16 RPG Icon Pack](https://kyrise.itch.io/kyrises-free-16x16-rpg-icon-pack)
 - [0x72's Dungeon Tileset II](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii)
