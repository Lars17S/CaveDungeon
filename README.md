# OOP_Project
As the final project in Orient Objected Programming, we will create a videogame

## Run
Use `javac **/*.java` at the root of the project to compile very java file, and `java src.game.Main` to run the game.

## Assets
We used two asset packs:
 - [Kyrise's Free 16x16 RPG Icon Pack](https://kyrise.itch.io/kyrises-free-16x16-rpg-icon-pack)
 - [0x72's Dungeon Tileset II](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii)
